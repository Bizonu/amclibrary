Advanced Modular Cryptographic Library is designed to provide easy to use cryptographic algorithms. For now only AES is supported for both CPU and GPU (using Direct 3D 10 API) implementation.

Supported modes of operation:
  * ECB encryption/decryption for 128, 192 and 256 bits key size
  * CBC decryption for 128, 192 and 256 bits key size (encryption is supported only by the CPU).
  * CTR encryption/decryption for 128, 192 and 256 bits key size
